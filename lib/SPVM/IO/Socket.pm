=head1 Name

SPVM::IO::Socket - Sockets

=head1 Description

IO::Socket class in L<SPVM> represents a socket.

=head1 Usage
  
  use IO::Socket;

=head1 Details

IO::Socket is an abstract class.

See L</"Well Known Child Classes"> about child classes of this class.

=head2 Socket Constant Values

See L<Sys::Socket::Constant|SPVM::Sys::Socket::Constant> about constant values for sockets.

=head2 Goroutine

Connect, accept, read, and write operations in IO::Socket class work with L<goroutines|SPVM::Go>.

Non-blocking mode of a L<IO::Socket|SPVM::IO::Socket> object is enabled.

If an IO wait occurs, control is transferred to another goroutine.

This allows you to write connect, accept, read, and write operations as if they were synchronous.
